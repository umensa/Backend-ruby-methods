# Create a program block_function.rb.
# It should have a function do_calc that calls a block using a yield statement.
# The yield statement will pass the numbers 7 and 9 to a block, and then will print out the result.
# Call the do_calc function twice in your program.
# The first time, pass a block that adds the two numbers.
# The second time, pass a block that multiplies the two numbers.
# Your program should print out 16 and 63.
